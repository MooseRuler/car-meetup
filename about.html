          I'm a fellow car enthusiast and my work revolves around IT. I wanted to make a website that would make it easier for not only me, but locals in my area to find the next Car Meet! Not only is it easier but also convenient. With scheduled meet ups planned months ahead of time. There should be no excuse why you can't make it to the next Car meet in town!
